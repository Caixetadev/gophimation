**Project**: gophimation

The core aim of this project is to correlate automation and efficiency to extract information available on the internet. All content accessible through the project is hosted by external non-affiliated sources.

Any content served through this project is publicly accessible. If your site is listed in this project, the code is virtually public. Take necessary measures to counter the exploits used to extract content on your site.

Think of this project as a regular browser, but a bit more straightforward and specific. While a typical browser makes hundreds of requests to get everything from a site, this project makes requests associated only with obtaining the content provided by the sites.

This project should be used at the user's own risk, in accordance with the laws and regulations of their government.

The project has no control over the content it is serving, and the use of copyrighted content from providers will not be the responsibility of the developer. It is at the user's own risk.

# DMCA and Copyright Infringements
A browser is a tool, and the maliciousness of the tool is directly based on the user. This project uses client-side content access mechanisms. Therefore, copyright infringements or DMCA claims related to this project should be forwarded to the associated site by the associated notifier of such claims. As of the writing, this applies to betteranime.
